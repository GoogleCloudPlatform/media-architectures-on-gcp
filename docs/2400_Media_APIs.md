Incorporating GCP AI Services into Media



Media APIs
Google has extensive experience running batch and live transcodes at scale. It is now bringing that expertise to its Cloud customers as fully managed media APIs that make it trivial to run large-scale, reliable, highly configurable, zero ops services for processing their media assets.
Media Transcoder
The media transcoder is a serverless transcode system that can be used to transcode assets at scale and with considerable flexibility. The GCP Media Transcoder takes a heavily parallelized approach to transcoding, which means that assets of various time durations can generally be transcoded in approximately the same amount of time. Also, the time taken to transcode is significantly lesser than the actual linear run time of the asset.
