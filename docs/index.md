## Preface
Media is one of the (if not **the**) largest use case on the internet today,
if measured by the sheer quantity of bits moved and viewership time spent.
By that metric, Media is truly the internet's "killer app" (dating myself severely here by that
mid-90's reference!).

This publication originally started out as a 2 paragraph document some time
back, mostly as a means to quickly share some information about Google Cloud CDN
with a few colleagues, and also as a means for me to collate the information I
was learning about running Media on GCP.

Over time, the Google Doc grew and grew to encompass a lot more information, as
more context was added about Media, its use cases, and various architectural
patterns that are well suited to address those needs. As more people within Google
read the document, I got more suggestions and feedback and the document grew further from there.

Instead of keeping that content locked up in a proprietary document, I felt it
was best to share it as widely as possible, so that I could learn from the 
largest possible community, and also create a resource that could be of help to
others just getting started in the field.

The choice of releasing as an OSS document on GitHub is to ensure that this
content doesn't stagnate, and is continuously updated with feedback from the
community, and hopefully, with their contributions too!

This is intended to be a living document, so please feel free to submit
comments, suggestions, file bugs, and even contribute to the content
at the [Media Architectures On GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/media-architectures-on-gcp) repo!
