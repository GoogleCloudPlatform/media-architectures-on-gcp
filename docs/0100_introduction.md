## How this book is organized
This book is written in two largely independent parts.

The first part, “An Overview of Digital Media” is an overview of key concepts in digital and cloud-based media delivery.
This section is to help individuals new to the world of digital media get a high level understanding of the
key concepts of digital media. This section is not a deep dive into actual encoding technologies, and the systems and
optimizations of digital encoding and transcoding: there is already an extensive library of those books available.
The overview section seeks to introduce non-media architects to the most important concepts in digital media so they
can understand the ideas being expressed by their media-centric colleagues. A seasoned media practitioner can safely
skip the first part of the book and go directly to the second part.

The second part, “Google Cloud for Media” is for media and non-media architects who are looking to operate their
digital media stacks in the cloud. This section goes into detail about specifics of Google Cloud’s platform and its
suitability for various media use cases, and how various architectures assist in achieving specific outcomes.

## Open sourcing
This book initially started out as a short explainer for architects new to the media space. Over time, the document
grew larger and longer as more information regarding media was added to it. Also, there were requests to share the
document with customers.

With that in mind, it seemed that open sourcing the content was the best thing to do: it would allow the largest group
of individuals to utilize the material, and it would remove all the complexity of access and acquisition. It seemed
like the right thing to do.
